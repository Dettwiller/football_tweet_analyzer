Dritewater Crake, Just a few quick thoughts about tonight's #FamilyNight practice and the upcoming preseason. (thread) #Packers, FamilyNight Packers, 2019-08-03 07:08:53
Dritewater Crake, Aaron Rodgers was actually looking like Aaron Rodgers out there tonight throwing dimes to Kumerow and Tae including a sharp throw for Tae in the EZ under coverage of Jaire in the 1-on-1 drills early on. #Packers, Packers, 2019-08-03 07:08:53
Dritewater Crake, Couldn't tell if the RBs are any good bc our top two RBs were both out with hamstring issues but Carson (I think?) had a real nice jump cut on one of his runs got to the next level. #Packers, Packers, 2019-08-03 07:08:54
Dritewater Crake, Tae Whitewater Jake and fast Trevor Davis were the standouts at receiver tonight. All three made fantastic plays. Tae is next-level. #Packers, Packers, 2019-08-03 07:08:54
Dritewater Crake, Big Bob Tonyan had a catch in the Move the Ball drill that I thought was good. I'm not sold on this TE group but we'll see what they do this August. #Packers, Packers, 2019-08-03 07:08:54
Dritewater Crake, In the trenches we got a little bit of the big battle of training camp — David Bakhtiari vs Za'Darius Smith. Bakhtiari is for my money the best LT in football and Z Smith has won a few 1-on-1s vs him with great power and speed. #Packers, Packers, 2019-08-03 07:08:54
Dritewater Crake, We're seeing what Mike Pettine D will really look like in Green Bay with a year under the belt and the system in place. And it looks good. #Packers, Packers, 2019-08-03 07:08:55
Dritewater Crake, Mason Crosby was out with his calf injury and in his place Kickin' Ficken had a mixed night missing FGs in team drills but then making 5/6 kicking drill kicks including a 63-yarder. #Packers, Packers, 2019-08-03 07:08:55
Dritewater Crake, Overall things seem to be going in a good direction. Offense needs work but that's not surprising in a whole new system. Defense looks strong 💪 and ST is ST I guess. #Packers, Packers, 2019-08-03 07:08:55
Dritewater Crake, First preseason game is next Thursday night at 7:00 vs Houston. We'll get a better idea of what things look like then when every play doesn't go for an uncontested scoooore haha. #Packers, Packers, 2019-08-03 07:08:55

Biancoverde, @WhoDey_UK I think we're all desperate for a good season. I'll even settle for not getting wins as long as we are competitive and everything looks like it has a plan and we're moving forward as a team. Might be a bit of short term pain for long term gain. I'm OK with that. #WhoDey, WhoDey, 2019-08-03 11:53:31

RaiderMike, Branch not being in the Hall is a travesty. You've got to stack his numbers up against receivers from his own era. Like Lynn Swann. That 4th alltime in post season receiving yards alone should get him in. HUGE money player a big game dude., , 2019-08-03 15:24:56
JT The Brick, There are several former #Raiders who could be selected for next years special Centennial @ProFootballHOF class. Cliff Brach &amp; Tom Flores are the PRIORITY. Coach Flores has 4 SB rings(1player 3 Coach). Cliff was the dominant speed receiver of his era with 3 rings. #raidernation, Raiders raidernation, 2019-08-03 15:24:57

John Ellis, Boston had a knack for making big plays in huge moments in the passing game. 2014 NFC South Title Game (week 17) 33 fielded a Matt Ryan pick. The play illustrates his elite timing speed and acceleration great assets for a deep safety. #Panthers https://t.co/TS4ZYZSWn9, Panthers, 2019-08-03 15:58:00

John Ellis, Another angle of the play reveals savvy work by Norman big nickel Jones and Boston. 24 actually hands off his assignment 33 baiting Ryan into a throw to the corner a spot 33 clearly anticipated. It takes a great deal of acceleration and timing to pull this off. #Panthers https://t.co/cSxSLGnmlH, Panthers, 2019-08-03 15:58:17

A Football Friend, @evansilva Such a good stat for context here.  Damien Williams more of an ok talent in a good situation than true RB1. Yet ADP is currently 2.08 which is insane…And that’s before the hamstring issue.  Feels like a Kevan Barlow “great end of season…bad next season” year coming.#Chiefs, Chiefs, 2019-08-03 17:50:59

The Fantasy Jones, WR: Kenny Golladay is a great talent but playing in a run-heavy offense limits his upside. This offense will likely only support one fantasy-relevant receiver due to its run-heavy nature.

Maurice Moton, If I’m the #Raiders I’d inquire about Clowney. Why not?I wouldn’t give up a major haul for him but he’s undoubtedly an upgrade from what they have now. They’d have to pay him sooner than later though. After the AB deal Mayock has earned trust if something goes down., Raiders, 2019-08-03 19:01:49

Nick Wagoner, #49ers closed practice with SS Jaquiski Tartt making a good read on pass over the middle from Garoppolo to Samuel but Tartt dropped the interception.

Jeff Bersch, Who really knows what he was doing? I’m not saying Lynch was good. But name another first-rounder who wasn’t given a chance? A few random starts? None back to back. Sometimes you just play a guy a lot to find out. Turns out Denver could have too. Someone loved Trevor too much., , 2019-08-03 21:45:12

Thank you for the trades, MLB teams, The part about Trubisky now underthrowing deep balls seems to me like maybe he's trying to compensate for Miller being a terrible deep ball route runner last year. So many of those "overthrows" were just Miller slowing down instead of running through the ball., , 2019-08-03 23:02:08

Deuce Windham, Here is a route concept I'm excepting to see more of from the #Saints this year.The magic of Colston/Graham together made for a potent threat of two big athletic bodies with nice hands on two sides of the field. Sluggo Seam.This year it should be Thomas/Cook https://t.co/kNuLQAf2Lp, Saints, 2019-08-04 02:44:35
Dominique, One thing that I'm keeping an eye on with the #Falcons is the TE play. I believe Koetter is going to feature the RB's as receivers more but I'm looking at the TE's. Their ability to execute blocks and be featured as receivers will determine what personnel packages can be featured, Falcons, 2019-08-04 02:44:40

Brady poppinga, That’s the advantage Of running with the QB. That is you’re gonna have just as many blockers as there are defenders. I love what Jim Harbaugh is doing with the L. Jackson!
